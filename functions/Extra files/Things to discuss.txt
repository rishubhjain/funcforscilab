Image and path seems to be a bad idea...instead work on return image that is processed..plus Display image


and the image should be coloured or grayscale...thats also a big thing

check the polygon function is drawing(not made the polygon function)...and also try the drawing functions in scilab


in Rotation function we need to give the parameter of angle....so not writting that function..cause i dont know where to give the parameter


Now this parameter issue is in every function..i realised this in simple Thresholding ...in cv2.thresholding the parameters we pass must be given by user...Since i dont know parameter name i am just doing the image thing..later on will modify

Now The Real Game Begins!!!
